## HOME

### **FairyDust**

We ARE an international tech community (helping nonprofits and social enterprises leverage the power of digital to amplify the power of people.). We see how governments and nonprofits are struggling because there is a lack of tech professionals who have the knowledge and understand their problems.
Because of this we personally went out and started to help in our private time. We started with developing Coding amigos to bring together entrepreneurial developers with activistic streak. It has now grown into vibrant collective of high professionals with sense for social responsibility. We understand the pulse of the time and current urgent crisis and we believe this situation can only be changed if organisations get enough professional digital support. Which is the reason that FairyDust.agency exists today.


### **Latest work**

we want to boost this field with more professional solutions. now we want to create a collective project of all these professionals
that want to


In our free time we built projects that are already helping real people. And this is how we realised how organisations which are working on the front line could make bigger impact if they only had supportive mobile solutions.


lack of tech people who understand
we are tech people and we personally felt called



and are personally involved with helping .
